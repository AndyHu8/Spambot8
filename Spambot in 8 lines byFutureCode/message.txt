Man



-You there. Orge!



-Aye?



-By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under 



arrest



and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility.



-Can I hum it?



-All right, hum it.



Humming







Grunts



Whimpering



-That's enough. He's ready to talk.



Coughing



Laughing



Clears throat



-Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the 



gingerbread man!



-You are a monster.



-I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy 



tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the 



others?



-Eat me!Grunts



-I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached 



its end! Tell me or I'll - -



-No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons.



-All right then. Who's hiding them?



-Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?



-The muffin man?



-The muffin man.



-Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?



-Well, she's married to the muffin man.



-The muffin man?



-The muffin man!



-She's married to the muffin man.



Door opens



-My lord! We found it.



-Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.



Man grunting



Gasping



-Oh!



-Magic mirror - - 



-Don't tell him anything!



-No!



Ginerbread man whispers



-Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect 



kingdom of them all?



-Well, technically you're not a king.



-Uh, Thelonius.



-You were saying?



-What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one.  All 



you have to do is marry a princess.



-Go on.



Chuckles



-So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to 



meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette 



number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. 






-Okay, okay, uh, number three!



-Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.







	

-Oh, really? You and what army?



Gasps, Whimpering



Chuckles



-Can I say something to you?



-Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. 



Incredible!



Are you talkin' to - - me? Whoa!



-Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great 



back here? Those guards!



They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They 



was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made 



me feel good to see that.



-Oh, that's great. Really.



-Man, it's good to be free.



-Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? 



Hmm?



-But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by 



myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. 



You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit 



out of anybody that crosses us.



Roaring



-Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that 



don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you 



definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks!



You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - 



Mumbling



Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my 



butt that day.



-Why are you following me?



-I'll tell you why. 







'Cause I'm all alone



There's no one here beside me



My promlems have all gone



There's no one to deride me



But you gotta heve friends - - 







-Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.



-Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.



-Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?



-Uh - - Really tall?



-No! I'm an orge! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't 



that bother you?



-Nope.



-Really?



-Really, really.



-Oh.



-Man, I like you. What's you name?



-Uh, Shrek.



-Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?



You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.



I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. 



Who'd want to live in place like that?



-That would be my home.



-Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a 



decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I 



like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.



-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?



-I like my privacy.



-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I 



hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them 



a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.



-Can I stay with you?



-Uh, what?



-Can I stay with you, please?



-Of course!



-Really?



-No.



-Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to 



be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta 



stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!



-Okay! Okay! But one night only.



-Ah! Thank you!



-What are you - - No! No!



-This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, 



and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.



-Oh!



-Where do, uh, I sleep?



-Outside!



-Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you 



don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know.



Sniffles



-Here I go.



-Good night.



Sighs



-I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. 



I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, 



outside.







I'm all alone



There's no one here beside me



Bubbling



Sighs



Creaking



Sighs



-I thought I told you to stay outside.



-I'm outside.



Clattering



-Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we 



have? 



-It's not home, but it'll do just fune.



-What a lovely bed.



-Got ya.



Sniffs I found some cheese.



-Ow! Grunts



-Blah! Awful stuff.



-Is that you, Gorder?



-How did you know?



-Enough! What are you doing in my house?



Grunts



-Hey!



Snickers



-Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.



-Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.



-Huh?



Gusps



Male voice What?



-I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying orge! What do I 



have to do get a little privacy?



-Aah!



-Oh, no. No! No!



Cackling



-What?



-Quit it.



-Don't push.



Squeaking



Lows



- What are you doing in my swamp?



Echoing



Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!



Gasping



-Oh, dear!



-Whoa!



-All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! 



Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!



-Quickly. Come on!



-No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.



-Oh!



Sighs



-Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.



-Oh, gosh, no one invited us.



-What?



-We were forced to come here.



 

-Get him! This way! Turn!
Vielen Dank, dass sie mitgemacht haben. Bis zum n√§chsten Mal!
